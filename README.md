# Ray-tracing software for mapping signal propagation profiles

This open-source software is based on the NIST QD realization (see [docs/Documentation.pdf](docs/Documentation.pdf)).

## Installation
The software does not require any installation procedure: simply download or clone the repository to your local folders.

## How to Run
* The software is configured to run the wireless network scenarios with arbitary layouts similar to the real environments.
* Run the `new_runner.m` script.


## Features
1. Ray-tracing based on the method of network attribute mapping.
1. Specifically tailored for high-frequency (e.g., 28-60 GHz) radio propagation, considering specular reflection and ignoring diffraction.
1. Quasi-Deterministic ray diffusion model based on real-world measurements is included.
1. Materials and Reflectivities are assigned for each obstacle, walls, ceiling, and floor.

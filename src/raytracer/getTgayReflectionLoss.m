% This function first calculates the reflectances for vertical and 
% horizontal polarization for each reflection using the incident angle and  
% relative permittivity of the material in the Fresnel equation.
% Subsequently, the reflection loss for each reflection is calculated by 
% the taking the average of the vertical and horizontal reflectances.
%
% Inputs:
% MaterialLibrary - contains each of the reflectors along with their
%   material and relative permittivity value
% arrayOfMaterials - array of materials corresponding to each of the planes
%   where a ray is reflected. The dats is the row number of material from 
%   MaterialLibrary. 
% multipath - consists of specular multipath parameters. This vector is
%   used to calculate angle(s) of incident and also to get information about
%   the order of reflection
%
% Output: 
% reflectionLossdB - ray reflection loss in dB
